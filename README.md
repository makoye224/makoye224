### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Emmanuel Makoye, and I am a highly motivated and skilled Full Stack Web Developer passionate about creating innovative and user-friendly web solutions. With a solid educational background and professional experience, I have a dedication to delivering high-quality projects that exceed expectations. Let me tell you a bit more about myself. 

Education: 
I am pursuing a BSc. in Computer Science from Case Western Reserve University with a  concentration in Software Engineering. I also have a Diploma in Leadership and Entrepreneurship from the African Leadership Academy in South Africa. 

Professional Experience and Projects: 
Currently, I am developing Sokoni, an e-commerce in Tanzania that will help improve the shopping experience of individuals looking for high-quality products and who want to avoid going through the frustrations brought by traditional shopping. I am using React framework to build the front end of the project and Django for the project's back end. The project has been an excellent source of knowledge and skills in complete stack web development frameworks, libraries, cloud computing and many more. For instance, I host media on AWS S3 to ensure scalability and reliability. 

I also have worked to build landing pages for Digital Lab company that works on brand creation, social media management, and graphic designing.

Additionally, I have a strong knowledge of Java programming language and have worked on projects to develop my data structure and algorithm skills. Most of the projects I have worked on are in my repositories.
